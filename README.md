# Some security related notes

I have started to write down notes on the security related videos I
watch (as a way of quick recall).

These might be more useful to beginners.

The order of notes here is _not_ in order of difficulty, but in
reverse chronological order of how I write them (i.e., latest first).

## The Notes Themselves

### Race Conditions & Exploiting Them

If a memory region (or file or any other resource) is accessed _twice_
with the assumption that it would remain same, but due to switching of
threads, we are able to change the value, we have a race condition.

Most common kind is a TOCTTOU (Time-of-check to Time-of-use), where a
variable (or file or any other resource) is first checked for some
value, and if a certain condition for it passes, then it is used. In
this case, we can attack it by continuously "spamming" this check in
one thread, and in another thread, continuously "flipping" it so that
due to randomness, we might be able to get a flip in the middle of the
"window-of-opportunity" which is the (short) timeframe between the
check and the use.

Usually the window-of-opportunity might be very small. We can use
multiple tricks in order to increase this window of opportunity by a
factor of 3x or even upto ~100x. We do this by controlling how the
value is being cached, or paged. If a value (let's say a `long int`)
is not alligned to a cache line, then 2 cache lines might need to be
accessed and this causes a delay for the same instruction to
execute. Alternatively, breaking alignment on a page, (i.e., placing
it across a page boundary) can cause a much larger time to
access. This might give us higher chance of the race condition being
triggered.

Smarter ways exist to improve this race condition situation (such as
clearing TLB etc, but these might not even be necessary sometimes).

Race conditions can be used, in (possibly) their extreme case, to get
ring0 code execution (which is "higher than root", since it is kernel
mode execution).

It is possible to find race conditions "automatically" by building
tools/plugins on top of architecture emulators. For further details,

### Types of "basic" heap exploits

Use-after-free:

Let us say we have a bunch of pointers to a place in heap, and it is
freed without making sure that all of those pointers are updated. This
would leave a few dangling pointers into free'd space. This is
exploitable by usually making another allocation of different type
into the same region, such that you control different areas, and then
you can abuse this to gain (possibly) arbitrary code execution.

Double-free:

Free up a memory region, and the free it again. If you can do this,
you can take control by controlling the internal structures used by
malloc. This _can_ get complicated, compared to use-after-free, so
preferably use that one if possible.

Classic buffer overflow on the heap (heap-overflow):

If you can write beyond the allocated memory, then you can start to
write into the malloc's internal structures of the next malloc'd
block, and by controlling what internal values get overwritten, you
can usually gain a read-what-where primitive, that can usually be
abused to gain higher levels of access (usually arbitrary code
execution, via the `GOT PLT`, or `__fini_array__` or similar).
